## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to develop a website which would showcase my skills, experience and a portfolio of projects to potential employers and clients.

## Functionality/features

The website was deisgned to be responsive. It will change to the narrow mobile/tablet deisgn when screen size drops below 960px.

The profile card and navbar remain stationary in desktop view while the main content to the right scrolls as required.

In mobile/tablet the navbar becomes horizontal and sticks to the top of the page while all other content scrolls.
